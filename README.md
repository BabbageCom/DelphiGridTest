All later versions of Delphi include Midas.dll 

In Project1.exe Midas.dll is included in the executable so you don't neer to install Delhpi to use this application

You can use any xml file; just put it in the current directory of "Project1.exe"

This programm can be used to test any Screenreader (NVDA, Jaws and Supernova)

If you want to have specific questions about what api calls are called for drawing titles of cells don't hesitate to send me a mail
